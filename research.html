<h1>Research <br /></h1>
</div>
<p> My research integrates ideas from three core areas — optimization, learning and control — and provides new theoretical frameworks and efficient algorithms to address a broad range of network science and planning problems. These problems span diverse disciplines and applications such as facility location with path optimization (FLPO), vehicle routing, sensor network design, manufacturing process parameter optimization, robotics, last mile delivery, job-shop scheduling, and data aggregation, classification, and clustering algorithms. The goal of my research has been to develop tools that are typically rooted in abstract formalism, and therefore address a general class of problems that span many areas, while at the same time are flexible enough to accommodate variations of specific applications. </p>

<h2>Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Systems - Industry 4.0</h2>
<p>The Industry 4.0 seeks to build efficient and flexible manufacturing capabilities that exploits the interactions between the manufacturing resources (mechanical and electrical equipments) and high-performance computing resources. The decision-making in these systems rely heavily on cyber-physical infrastructure that collects, curates, stores, and analyses data to make suitable planning and scheduling decisions, and pre-empt system failures and deadlocks. To this end, designing <b>data-driven decision-making </b> algorithms that are flexible to incorporating constraints and customer demands, and resilient to risks is of paramount importance. The work in this project will target various optimization problems in cyber-physical manufacturing systems and will be dealt within a much more generalized settings.</p>

<h2>Combining Robust Control and Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safety-Critical AI</h2>
<p>I am interested in reconciling robust control with deep reinforcement learning for safety-critical AI applications. I
am currently investigating the convergence properties of model-free policy gradient methods for various standard robust
control tasks. I am also developing new robust reinforcement learning methods by leveraging ideas from robust control and risk sensitive control.
Finally, I am working on control validation tools that can be used to certify the robustness and safety of interconnected systems with deep neural nets in the loop.  </p>


<h2>Optimization is Control</h2>
<p> Optimization can be viewed as a control problem. By viewing the gradient of the cost function
as a plant one wants to control, the optimization problem becomes an output regulation control problem.
Consequently, first-order optimization methods can be viewed as controllers regulating the plant. For example, gradient descent,
Nesterov’s method, and heavy-ball method can all be viewed as special cases of the proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) controllers. My current research focus is on translating “controllers” into “optimization
methods” for large-scale unconstrained and constrained optimization problems in machine learning, control, robotics, smart buildings, and power systems.</p>
